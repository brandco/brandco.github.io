At the 2016 Tableau User Conference in Austin, TX, I participated in a hackathon. My team's submission demonstrated how to integrate third party graphics into Tableau Dashboards. The demo showed how R and JavaScript graphics could be embedded into Tableau Dashboards. 

In July 2018, Tableau released the Extensions API that implements this functionality. The Extensions API allows developers to create custom extensions that can be embedded into Tableau Dashboards.

The repo for this project is [here](https://github.com/brandco/ThirdPartyTableau).

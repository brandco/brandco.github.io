As the director of data science at HDR I was responsible for hiring and managing data scientists and data engineers. These are slides showing some of the work that we did at HDR.

I lead a team of data scientist on consulting engagements with clients in healthcare and other industries. We built out systematic data analysis pipelines to perform these types of analysis on data we collected on business plans, and electronic medical records.

HISTORICAL REVIEW
How do patients and community residents know whether the hospital in their
community, or the hospital they are unfortunate enough to be in as a patient is a
good hospital? How does a patient know if an outside organization has reviewed
the systems, the procedures, the physicians, nurses, and all else in the hospital to
make sure it is all working properly? Fortunately, a group whose sole purpose is
to review hospitals exists. It then informs hospitals, patients, and the community
whether a hospital is satisfactory. This process of review is called hospital accreditation,
and the group that undertakes this is called the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), formerly known as the
Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH).
The JCAHO traced its roots to a program called the Hospital Standardization
Program that the American College of Surgeons established in 1918. The college
established the program to enable surgeons to understand and appreciate the uniform
medical records format that would allow them to evaluate members who
wished to apply for fellowship status in the American College of Surgeons. From
this beginning, the group joined with three other groups—the American College

of Physicians, the American Medical Association, and the American Hospital
Association—to form the JCAH. On January 1, 1952, the Joint Commission officially
began its work of surveying hospitals and granting accreditation. After its
first year, it was clear that it had to have a more dynamic nature, and its standards
were amended slightly. Ever since then, the Joint Commission has done a credible
job of keeping up with new standards in the United States and constantly
revising its approach to those standards. In the early years of the Joint
Commission, up until 1961, field studies were done by member organizations that
were part of the JCAH. In 1961, the Joint Commission hired its own full-time
field staff.
In 1964, the Joint Commission began to charge a survey fee to hospitals in
order to complete its field program. With the passage of Medicare legislation,
Public Law 89-97 in 1965, the Joint Commission was given a necessary boost. It
was written into the Medicare Act that hospitals participating under Medicare
had to meet a certain level of quality of patient care as measured against a recognized
norm. The JCAHO was specifically referred to in the law and hospitals
were told they could undergo either a Medicare survey or a JCAHO survey. This
was reaffirmed by the Social Security Administration in its standards of 1965.
While the JCAHO introduced medical audit requirements in the early 1970s,
it also adopted broad requirements concerning the review and evaluation of the
quality and appropriateness of health care. In 1979, the JCAHO developed new
standards that required hospitals to develop quality improvement programs according
to the quality assessment activities required by JCAHO standards. The
Joint Commission has since adopted this standard for all other types of health
care organizations that it accredits, and JCAHO’s focus has essentially become
quality improvement. The change of name from the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Hospitals to Joint Commission of Healthcare Organizations that
occurred in September 1987 more accurately reflects its mission and the constituencies
it serves. Today, JCAHO often surveys home health agencies, hospice
care, and other types of health care providers.
During the 1980s, JCAHO became more involved in the use of information
systems. It now uses a computerized system in its survey analysis process. The
Joint Commission also has a database that can help explain variations in outcomes
of hospital care. The database represents a potential use of performance
data to improve quality of care.
ACCREDITATION OVERVIEW
How does a hospital become accredited? The hospital completes an application
and asks the JCAHO, located in Chicago, to survey the hospital. The Joint
Commission sends to the hospital a large, complex, comprehensive questionnaire


that addresses standards for a hospital. After the hospital has completed the questionnaire
and returned it, a survey team is assigned by JCAHO and a date is
selected for a site visit to the hospital.
The questionnaire, and therefore the standards, are concerned with three major
areas:
1. The services and quality of services the hospital delivers to the patient.
The JCAHO reviews the medical staff organization and systems, nursing,
dietary services, the pharmacy, respiratory care, imaging, physical therapy,
emergency department services, etc. It determines whether services provided
are adequate for patients. It is important to note that laboratories are
surveyed by their own association, that of the College of American
Pathologists (CAP). Both the Joint Commission and Medicare recognize
this in lieu of conducting their own survey.
2. The principles of organization and administration. Does the hospital have
an effective bylaws structure? Does it have written policies and procedures?
Does it require its departments to meet on a regular basis and to
present written reports? Is the board involved and does it provide adequate
oversight?
3. The physical plant and the environment in the hospital. This includes lifesafety
code problems, whether the hospital has adequate sprinkler systems,
whether the corridors are large enough, whether there are proper safety
exits, etc.
Recently, the Joint Commission has been spending a great deal of time and
effort on quality improvement reviews in patient care areas. The surveyors review
patient medical records and other reports to determine whether care given is
appropriate for a specific case.
The Joint Commission publishes a reference manual for hospitals called the
Accreditation Manual for Hospitals (AMH). This manual contains the standards
used by the Joint Commission to evaluate hospitals. The reader is cautioned that
the JCAHO periodically changes its standards to maintain best practices for hospitals.
It is imperative that the hospital to be surveyed is current on the latest survey
standards.
ACCREDITATION IN MORE DETAIL
After the hospital completes the survey and the questionnaire, a JCAHO survey
team is scheduled to visit the hospital. The JCAHO survey team consists of
a physician, a nurse, and sometimes a hospital administrator. If it is a large hospital,
the survey team may consist of three members and usually takes 3 to 4 days


to complete the survey. If it is a very small hospital, there may be two members
(a physician and a nurse) and the survey may involve only a 2- to 3-day visit.
The survey is quite complete and well organized. Each member of the survey
team has a specific area to observe and survey. During the survey, which is actually
a walk-through of the hospital, the surveyors read procedure manuals and minutes
of meetings, look at life-safety code issues such as smoke barriers and sprinkler
systems, examine crash carts to ensure they are periodically inventoried and
inspected at the change of each nursing shift, interview personnel, and note any
deficiencies observed in the hospital. They then make recommendations. Before
they leave the hospital, they give their list to the hospital administrator at a formal
exit briefing. The survey team reviews with the administrator and key members
of the administrator’s staff exactly what they found in need of improvement
and what they recommend. This is a very open, candid discussion on how the hospital
can improve itself. The surveyors send their list and reports to JCAHO headquarters,
where they are reviewed in detail. Finally, the JCAHO makes a decision,
based upon the survey, whether the hospital should be accredited. Though many
hospitals receive accreditation from the JCAHO, there are different modifiers to
the accreditation; e.g., accreditation with commendation, accredited, or conditionally
accredited.
After a hospital has been accredited by the JCAHO, it receives a certificate of
accreditation indicating this achievement. If it receives a three-year accreditation,
it must, in the interim period before the next JCAHO visit, complete a detailed
questionnaire identifying what was done to correct the deficiencies noted in the
original survey. The interim questionnaire is sent to the Joint Commission in
Chicago where it is evaluated.
The JCAHO is important in the evaluation of hospitals in the United States. It
is unique because it is voluntary. The JCAHO has been responsive to hospitals
and the state and federal government. It provides a silent service to the patient and
community; it maintains high professional standards; it acts as an advisory group
to hospitals and is influential in urging hospitals to improve their life-safety measures,
their quality improvement programs, and their organizations.
WHAT DOES ACCREDITATION REALLY MEAN TO A HOSPITAL?
The hospital that has become accredited says to its community, its patients, and
staff that it wants to meet high standards and that it has exerted the effort and time
to have the Joint Commission measure it against a set standard. Accreditation tells
a hospital’s employees and patients that the environment is of high quality and
personnel are qualified to provide care. Accreditation emphasizes that the hospital
is a responsible institution that takes its obligations for patient care seriously
and has asked an independent, objective group to review it.


SENTINEL EVENTS
The Joint Commission requires health care organizations to report sentinel
events, which are defined as unexpected occurrences involving death, serious
physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof. This includes unanticipated
death or major permanent loss of function not related to a patient’s illness. It also
includes events such as surgery on the wrong patient or body part, infant abductions,
patients who commit suicide or are raped while in the hospital, or transfusion
reactions caused by major blood group incompatibilities.
After reporting a sentinel event, the organization should conduct a root cause
analysis to uncover the basic factor(s) that led to the problem. This should assist
the organization in enhancing their performance outcomes and avoiding similar
problems. In addition to the thorough investigation, the organization should seek
“best practices” (as defined in the current literature and the seminars held by professional
groups) and make changes to reduce future instances. They should identify
who will be responsible for necessary changes, set a time line for the changes,
educate the staff regarding the change, and then implement and monitor the
changes, evaluating the effectiveness of the change.
JOINT COMMISSION INTERNATIONAL
As the reader has learned in other parts of this text, many hospitals voluntarily
undertake an accreditation survey from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations in order to 1) receive federal funding, 2) demonstrate to
the public that they are a quality institution, or 3) to improve their own internal
processes.
Hospitals outside the United States have wanted a similar accreditation process
so that they may demonstrate quality and thus attract patients and physicians. In
1999, the Joint Commission announced standards for international hospitals
under the name Joint Commission International (JCI). Hospitals outside the
United States may apply for an accreditation survey, prepare for the survey, and
then receive a site visit from a survey team. The accreditation visit is conducted
in a similar manner to that of one in the United States.
LICENSURE
The JCAHO reviews and surveys are the primary controls over hospitals. In
fact, the accreditation is somewhat like an informal license, particularly since the
federal government, under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Medicare legislation,
Public Law 89-97, has endorsed the Joint Commission’s survey in order to certify
payment for hospitals under Medicare legislation. There are other forms of
control working in the hospital system as well.


Formal licensing is the most common form of regulation by the states.
Generally, a license to operate a hospital is issued by a state agency, perhaps the
health department. The licensing bureau or agency can retain records of a hospital’s
bed capacity and the capabilities of its other facilities. The states’ health and
welfare departments account for three quarters of the state agencies that have regulatory
powers over hospitals. A state’s licensure laws and regulations usually
culminate in a licensure inspection that is similar to the inspection conducted by
the JCAHO. This accounts for one of the overlaps in the regulatory system.
Frequently, state and Joint Commission inspectors inspect the same things, or the
state will accept the JCAHO accreditation process and not conduct an inspection.
The JCAHO reciprocally shares survey information with state and district
licensure agencies regarding a hospital’s accreditation surveys. In turn, these
agencies report information about potential standard-related problems in accredited
hospitals to the Joint Commission. Reciprocally sharing information enables
both the Joint Commission and licensure agencies to identify hospitals that have
performance problems, and as a result, require further review.
MEDICARE CERTIFICATION
Another form of control used for hospitals beyond licensure is the process of
Medicare certification. Hospitals must be certified since the 1965 Social Security
Amendments that sponsored Titles XVIII and XIX. At that time, the federal government
established a way for hospitals to participate in federal insurance programs,
but indicated that they had to meet certain general compliance guidelines
to do so. For example, hospitals could establish an around-the-clock nursing staff,
certain medical supervision, and the proper use of clinical records. This step then
led to formal Medicare surveys.
Medicare Survey
Should a hospital not wish to undertake a Joint Commission survey (usually
because these are expensive, involving fees to JCAHO and considerable preparation
time needed to be successful) the hospital may opt to undertake a Medicare
survey. Without a successfully completed JCAHO or Medicare survey, the hospital
will not qualify for Medicare funding.
REGISTRATION
Registration is a weak form of control in the system. It might not even be
regarded by hospital authorities as a control. However, a system of registration
exists that identifies hospitals and other health care institutions in order for third


parties, consumers, and federal agencies to review the rosters of such institutions.
The most common registration in the hospital system is conducted by the
American Hospital Association (AHA). The AHA maintains an extensive system
of data collection in the form of hospital profiles. It is also involved in registering
hospitals in planning areas. For example, the AHA reviews new construction, proposed
mergers, and the proposed sharing of services. The AHA publishes an
annual hospital statistics report that includes data from many of its registration
activities
